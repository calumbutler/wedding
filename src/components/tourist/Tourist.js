                  <h3>Kilkenny Castle</h3>
                  <p>Kilkenny Castle is a castle in Kilkenny, built in 1195 to control a fording-point of the River Nore and the junction of several routeways. It was a symbol of Norman occupation and in its original thirteenth-century condition it would have formed an important element of the defences of the town with four large circular corner towers and a massive ditch, part of which can still be seen today on the Parade.</p>

                  <h3>Canices Cathedral</h3>
                  <p>St Canice’s Cathedral is one of the most prominent sights in Kilkenny, which was once a splendid Medieval city. Many believe the construction of the massive Gothic cathedral began in the 1250s and was completed in 1285, but the religious roots of the site extend back to the 6th Century, when the Church of St Canice stood here. Over the years, the cathedral has maintained many of its 13th Century features despite the collapse of the central tower in 1332 and the overtaking of the property by Oliver Cromwell’s troops in 1650. </p>

                  <h3>Woodstock Gardens</h3>
                  <p>Woodstock House was built in 1745-47 for Sir William Fownes by the architect Francis Bindon. It has a rusticated front facade and is unusual in being built around a small central court. The decorative emphasis of the house was focused upon the front facade. In 1804-06 flanking wings were added to designs by William Robertson. The service yards either side were added at the same time. Both the main house and the wings were built of stone with brick lining inside. The basement vaulting was, unusually, also of brick. Only parts of the east and west walls of the centre block and parts of the wings had no internal brick lining. Like many early 18th century Irish country houses, the decorative emphasis of the building was focused upon the front facade. The five bay garden frontage is much plainer though a very decorative iron staircase was added in the 1850″s by Richard Turner, the famous iron master.</p>
